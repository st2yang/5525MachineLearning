## HW3
This is the folder for homework 3 which is mianly about tensorflow APIs. The assignment is to use tensorflow to do classification on MNIST dataset using several methods: (1) logistic regression (2) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (3) Long short-term memory (LSTM)

## Dependencies
The implementation mainly depend on these libraries
- tensorflow
- tensorboard

## main files
The commands to run the scripts in the code/ in the terminal
- logistic regression: python3 TFLogRegStarter.py
- CNNs: python3 ConvNetTemplate.py
- CNNs v2: python3 ImproveLogReg.py
- LSTM: python3 LSTM.py
